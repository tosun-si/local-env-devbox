# local-env-devbox

This project demonstrates how to set up a local development environment using Devbox.

### Key Features:

- Fully isolated environments: Create a dedicated local environment for each project or GitHub repository, complete with Python, Poetry, and Terraform.
- Seamless automation: Automatically load and unload the Devbox environment using Direnv.
- Effortless package management: Use Poetry within the Devbox to create the Python environment and manage dependencies.
- Integrated development: Install the SDK directly from the virtual environment in IntelliJ IDEA.
- Smooth execution: Launch applications seamlessly from IntelliJ for a streamlined workflow.

This setup ensures a robust, efficient, and fully isolated development experience tailored for Python projects, while also accommodating additional tools like Terraform.
